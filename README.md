# flowysurf

![flowysurf logo](public/logo-light-mode.svg)

*flowysurf* is a lightweight visual project manager optimized for planning milestones and tasks with a clean UI. Drag nodes, connect task flows, and track milestone progress â€” milestones automatically aggregate upstream Task completion. Built with speed and UX in mind.

## ðŸŒŠ How does it work?

FlowySurf is a visual map editor for designing workflows and milestones. It focuses on making it easy to model task dependencies and track progress across milestones. Key ideas:

- Nodes represent Start, Task, or Milestone elements.
- Edges represent flow/dependency between nodes (one node flows into another).
- Milestones automatically count upstream Task nodes and show completion progress.
- TaskNodes expose a main checkbox that marks the task complete. Subtasks are local and do not count towards milestone completion.

## âœ¨ Features

- Drag & drop nodes
- Create Task and Milestone nodes quickly
- Chain tasks and have Milestones aggregate upstream completion
- Live progress bar on Milestone nodes
- Confetti celebration when a Milestone completes (because milestones deserve celebration)
- Import/export .flowy files; your data is your own

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick usage

1. Open the app (run locally or visit [flowy.surf](https://flowy.surf/)).
2. Add nodes with the bottom right + button (Task / Milestone).
3. Connect nodes by dragging a handle from the source to the target.
4. Use the large checkbox on Task nodes to mark a task complete â€” Milestones will update automatically.
5. Click a Milestone title to edit it; the steps header will reflect the name.

## ðŸ›  Development

Requirements

- Node.js 16+
- npm or pnpm

Getting started

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# start dev server
npm run dev
```
Local storage

The app autosaves state to `localStorage` under the key `flowymap-v1`. Use the UI export/import buttons to move maps between machines.

Project structure (brief)

- `src/pages/Map.jsx` â€” main editor and React Flow wrapper
- `src/components/nodes/` â€” custom node components (TaskNode, MilestoneNode, StartNode)
- `src/lib/flowEvents.js` â€” small emitter used to notify nodes of graph changes
